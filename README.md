This is a Simple Sentiment Analysis Model created using Machine Learning Concepts.
1. Initially, Gathering the datasets is the primary task for us.
2. It may be whatsapp, twitter, kaggle or any other social media platforms.
3. Then, preprocess the data using data science and pandas library and prepare it for the model building process. (Data Cleaning).
4. Separate the message and sentiment into X and Y tables and split it into training and testing datasets.
5. Build the model by passing the parameters X and Y and specila parameters.
6. Check for the Accuracy of the model.
7. Predict the values of the model by passing the testing dataset into the trained model.
8. Deploy the model, if possible, using Streamlit or Flask Web Interface.
